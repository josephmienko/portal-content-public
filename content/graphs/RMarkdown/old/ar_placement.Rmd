### Summary

This graph shows the rate at which screened-in reports---reports that receive an investigation or other service---led to an out-of-home placement.

#### Questions this graph can answer

- What has been the risk that a household that received an investigation or other service eventually had an out-of-home placement following a screened-in report?

- Which regions had the highest and lowest rates of placement?

#### See also

- [Screening Rate](https://portal.cssat.org/visualizations/screening-rate), for the rate at which reports were screened-in for investigation or other services.

- [Out-of-Home Entries (Rates)](https://portal.cssat.org/visualizations/ooh-entry-rates), for the population-based rate of placements.

### Notes

A household is considered to have a placement if *one or more* children in the household entered out-of-home care.

Additional reports are only counted if there has been more than 48 hours since the previous report about the same household.
