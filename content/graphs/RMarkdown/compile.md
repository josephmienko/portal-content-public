## Title: Timely Adoption

 **Subtitle:** Within One Year of Becoming Legally Free

 **Blurb:** Children adopted within one year of becoming legally free.

 **Slug:** timely-adoption

 **Unit:** Percent

### Data Highlights


Recent: July 01, 2014:
64%



Low: July 01, 2000:
43%



High: July 01, 2011:
73%


### Summary

This graph examines the percentage of children that were adopted within one year of becoming legally free. Children are considered legally free once their legal parents' parental rights have been terminated.

#### Questions this graph can answer

- Has timely adoption been impacted by location?

- Has the timeliness of adoptions changed over time?

#### See also

- [Permanency Count](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/permanency-counts), for a comparison of the number of children who exit to different permanency outcomes.

- [Permanency Outcomes](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/permanency-cohort), for a comparison of different permanency outcomes by the length of time a child was in out-of-home care.

### Notes

The Adoptions & Safe Families Act of 1997 requires all states to hold a first permanency hearing within 12 months of the date the child entered out-of-home care. States are also required to file a petition to terminate parental rights for children in care for 15 of the most recent 22 months.

Like the federal [CFSR](http://partnersforourchildren.org/resources/glossary#155) measure, this percent is calculated by dividing the number of children adopted within a given by all the children who became legally free in that same year.

- [Siblings by Number of Siblings](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/siblings-number), for the percentage of siblings placed together on a particular day, with a breakdown by the number of children in the family.

### Notes 

This rate is calculated by dividing the number of substantiated cases of maltreatment among children in out-of-home care in a given year by the number of out-of-home care-days for all children for that year, times 100,000. As a point of reference, approximately 2.9 million care-days were provided in 2013; 100,000 care-days represent 3% to 4% of the care-days provided in a year.

- How has the rate of placement moves changed over time?

#### See also

- [Placements in Family Settings](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/family-settings), for the number children are placed in family settings.

### Notes

Rates are calculated per 100,000 care-days. A care-day is one day that a child spends in out-of-home care. Fourteen care-days could either be two weeks that one child spends in out-of-home care, or 1 day that 14 children spend in out-of-home care.

Moves to the initial placement, moves home on a six month trial basis, moves to a permanent home, moves to or from any 'non-child welfare placement,' such as a juvenile detention center, and moves to an out-of-home care placement that lasts less than seven days are not counted.

 **Unit:** Reports per 1,000 Households with Children

### Data Highlights


No Prior Reports:
1.6



One Prior Report:
5.3



Two Prior Reports:
10.1


### Summary

This graph shows the rate of reports of concern for child safety made to Children's Administration. All calls to the child welfare system - those made by community members and those made by mandated reporters - are counted. (See *Notes* below for how we determine if a call is regarding child safety concerns.)

#### Questions this graph can answer

- How does the risk that a household will be reported to Children's Administration for a CPS investigation or other services change based on a history of prior reports?

#### See also

- [Screening Rate](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/screening), for how many of these reports are screened-in for services.

### Notes:

Reports are only counted if there has been more than 48 hours since the previous report about the same household.

We exclude any calls that are classed as Department of Licensing Resources (DLR). We also exclude a handful of other rare categories that are not usually associated with safety concerns including *Information Only*, *Home Study*, and *Family Voluntary Service*.

The rate of the reports with no (zero) prior reports is calculated by dividing the number of households with a first report in a given month by the number of households who have not had any prior reports at the start of the month.

The rate of the reports with one prior report is calculated by dividing those households experiencing a second report in a given month by the number of households who have had exactly one report prior to the start of the month. This continues similarly for additional prior reports.

#### See also

- [Report Rate](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/report-rate), for the overall rate of reports.
- [Placement Rate](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/placement-rate), for the rate at which screened-in reports result in out-of-home placement.

### Notes

All screened-in reports receive services; depending on the details this could be a CPS investigation, a CPS Risk-Only assessment, an alternative response such as [Family Assessment Response (FAR)](http://partnersforourchildren.org/resources/glossary#Family Assessment Response (FAR)) or Family Reconciliation Services (FRS).

Reports are only counted if there has been more than 48 hours since the previous report about the same household.

### Summary

Households with previous screened-in reports are more likely to be screened-in again; this graph shows how much the screening rate increases. The screening rate is the rate at which public reports of concern for child safety made to Children's Administration are screened-in for a CPS investigation or assessed for receipt of other services.

#### Questions this graph can answer

- How does the screening rate differ for households with prior screened-in reports?

#### See also

- [Report Rate](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/report-rate), for the overall rate of reports.
- [Placement Rate](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/placement-rate), for the rate at which screened-in reports result in out-of-home placement.

### Notes

All screened-in reports receive services; depending on the details of the case the service might be a CPS investigation, a CPS risk assessment, an alternative response such as [Family Assessment Response (FAR)](http://partnersforourchildren.org/resources/glossary) or Family Reconciliation Services (FRS).

The rate of screened-in reports with no (zero) prior screened-in reports is calculated by dividing the number of households with a first report in a given month by the number of households who have not had any prior reports at the start of the month.

The rate of screened-in reports with one prior screened-in report is calculated by dividing those households experiencing a second report in a given month by the number of households who have had exactly one report prior to the start of the month, and so on.

Reports are only counted if there has been more than 48 hours since the previous report about the same household.

## Title: Siblings Placed Together

 **Subtitle:** Percent of Care-Days

 **Blurb:** Time that siblings in out-of-home care are placed partially or all together.

 **Slug:** sibling-care-days

 **Unit:** Percent of Care-Days

### Data Highlights


July 01, 2014:
88%



July 01, 2000:
89%


### Summary

This graph shows the percent of sibling care-days spent together in a fiscal year. All siblings in a family who are in out-of-home care are included.

#### Questions this graph can answer

- What percentage of time that siblings spend in out-of-home care is spent with some or all of their siblings who are also in care?

- If a child is in out-of-home care and so is their sibling, what is the probability they were in the same placement on a given day?

#### See also

- [Siblings by Number of Siblings](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/siblings-number), for a snapshot of siblings placed together on a particular day, with a breakdown by the number of children in the family.

### Notes

In some cases, a child's best interests necessitate placement separate from their sibling(s) or in a non-family setting (e.g., to obtain specialized services in order to accomplish specific therapeutic goals).

If three brothers/sisters are in out-of-home care for 1 week, then there are 21 care-days provided. If two of the siblings are placed together for that time, with the third in a separate placement, then 14 of the care-days are together, so 67% of the care-days are together.

By default, we count all permanency outcomes. To select only out-of-home care episodes lasting more than one week, use the advanced filter *duration of out-of-home stay*.

## Title: Placements in Family Settings

 **Subtitle:** On the First Day of the Year

 **Blurb:** Children placed in family (and non-family) settings on the first day of the year.

 **Slug:** family-settings

 **Unit:** Percent

### Data Highlights


Foster Home Setting:
53%



Kin Placement:
41%

6%


### Summary

This graph shows the percent of children in different placement settings on the first day of each year. There are three types of *family settings*: kinship care, state-licensed foster homes, and privately-licensed foster homes. *Non-family settings* includes shelter care and group care.

#### Questions this graph can answer

- What percent of children in out-of-home-care were in a kinship care placement this year?

- Are state-licensed or privately-licensed foster homes more common on the east side of the state (e.g., Spokane County) or the west side (e.g., Pierce County)?

 **Subtitle:** Year-Long Out-of-Home Entry Cohort

 **Blurb:** Following an out-of-home cohort to see the timing of permanency outcomes (reunification, adoption, guardianship, emancipation).

 **Slug:** permanency-cohort

### Data Highlights


36 Months After Entering Care:
Still in Care: 16%



:
Reunified: 56%



:
Adopted: 17%


### Summary

This graph follows cohorts of children entering out-of-home care in a year to see how long they spend in care and what permanency outcome they achieve.

#### Questions this graph can answer

- How long do children spend in out-of-home care?

- How does the speed of adoption compare to the speed of reunification?

 **Slug:** ooh-re-entry

 **Unit:** Percent

### Data Highlights


Reunification :
17%



Adoption :
1%



Guardianship:
7%


### Summary

This graph examines re-entry into out-of-home care. It shows the percentage of children who exited out-of-home care to a permanent outcome (reunification, adoption, or guardianship) and later re-entered out-of-home care.

#### Questions this graph can answer

- What type of permanency placement do most children re-enter out-of-home care from?

#### See also

- [Placement Rate by Prior Placement](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/placement-rate-priors), for a look at how much more likely a placement is for a household with a prior history of out-of-home care.

- [Children Entering Out-of-Home Care (Count)](http://pocdata.org/visualizations/ooh_entries_counts), for a count of children entering out-of-home care.

### Notes

This is cohort data based on when children exited care. Recent cohorts (in the last 4 years) have less data available due to the shorter follow-up time.

If a child has a name change associated with an adoption, then we are unable to link the pre-adoption record to a post-adoption re-entry. Thus the re-entry following adoption is an underestimate of the true rate.
