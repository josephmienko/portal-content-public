### Data Highlights

### Summary

These PDFs provide you with condensed summary reports of the detailed information available to you via many of our visualizations. Just select a county from the list below and a custom report of key measures for your jurisdiction will appear in PDF format. (Note that these reports are not available at this time for small counties. Adams, Asotin, Columbia, Ferry, Garfield, Klickitat, Lincoln, Pacific, Pend Oreille San Juan, Skamania, and Wahkiakum counties have fewer than 25,000 residents, and tend to have very few children placed in out-of-home care, which makes automatic reporting difficult.
