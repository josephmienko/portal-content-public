### Summary

This graph shows the population data used to calculate population rates for children.
Population counts are used as the denominators for all of the child-based rates.

- [Map of Out-of-Home Entries](https://portal.cssat.org/visualizations/ooh-entries-map), for the rate at which children entered out-of-home care.

### Notes

We use data both from the US Census Bureau and Washington's Office of Financial Management and carefully fill in the gaps to produce this relatively complete picture of Washington State's population under age 18.
