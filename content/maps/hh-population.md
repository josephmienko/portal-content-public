### Summary

This shows the population data used to calculate household rates. 
Population counts are the denominators for all the household-based rates.

### Notes

We used data both from the US Census Bureau and Washington's Office of Financial Management and carefully filled in the gaps to produce this relatively complete picture of Washington's population of households with children.
