### Summary

This map shows the rate at which children entered out-of-home care by region or county.
All entries into out-of-home care were counted in this measure, including voluntary placements and short stays in care.

### Notes

Small counties often have very volatile data - high one year, low the next - due to the small population sizes. Don't read too much into data from small counties unless patterns are consistent across years.
