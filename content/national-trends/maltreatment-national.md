### Summary

This graph shows victims of substantiated maltreatment per 1,000 children for all 50 states for each year since 2004.

#### Questions this graphs answers

- Which states have had the highest and lowest rates of child maltreatment?

- How has my state compared to other states for child maltreatment?

<!-- NOTE: measure is deprecated -->
<!-- #### See also

- [Placement Rate by Prior Placement](https://portal.cssat.org/visualizations/placement-rate-order), to see how much more likely an out-of-home placement is in Washington State for a household with a prior history of out-of-home care. -->

### Notes

Precise definitions of maltreatment vary from state to state, as do the child welfare systems that investigate them. For example, 

- In Washington State, a substantiated allegation of maltreatment *is not necessary* for a child to be placed in out-of-home care; rather, a decision to place a child is based on whether or not there is an ongoing risk of harm.

- In California, a substantiated allegation of maltreatment *is necessary* for a child to be placed in out-of-home care.

For each year, these data count the *number of unique victims of substantiated child maltreatment*, not the number of substantiated incidents of maltreatment. If a child was a substantiated victim several times in a year, they will have only been counted once. If a substantiated incident of maltreatment had multiple victims, each victim will have been counted.

The visualization was adapted from and inspired by Nathan Yau's [visualization of life expectancy by country](http://projects.flowingdata.com/life-expectancy/).
