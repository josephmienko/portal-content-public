With a collection of interactive data visualization tools, the Child Well-Being Data Portal promotes access to and understanding of child welfare by providing detailed, customizable information about the vulnerable children and families served by human service systems in Washington State and beyond. 

The Child Well-Being Data Portal is a joint project of the Center for Social Sector Analytics & Technology (CSSAT) and Partners for Our Children (POC). CSSAT and POC work to bring tools such as the Data Portal to social workers, parents, advocates, and policy-makers that will help improve the lives of vulnerable children and families in Washington State, especially those touched by the child welfare system.

### Where does the data come from?

The data for our visualization tools come from multiple source, most notably from the Washington State Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF). Through a partnership with DCYF, we have access to quarterly deidentified data extracts from FamLink, the case management information system used by DCYF. In addition, data comes from the US Census Bureau, Washington’s Office of Financial Management, the National Data Archive of Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN), and other sources as indicated.

### How can I use the data?

The Data Portal aims to provide policymakers, advocates, researchers and the community with information about child welfare in Washington State. 

The data could be used in a number of ways, including, but not limited to: 
* Explore the workings of the child welfare system
* Give context for grant applications
* Incorporate data in research projects

#### Publication Notes: 

* If you publish data from the Data Portal, please read the Info page for the measure(s) to gain a clear understanding of all details related to the data.
* Please cite Center for Social Sector Analytics & Technology and link to the Data Portal, where appropriate. A suggested citation format (MLA) is “[Title of Measure].” Center for Social Sector Analytics & Technology Child Well-Being Data Portal, [data update date]. Web. [Date of Access].

### How are the data calculated?

Most measures provide basic information on their respective info pages. Filter Definitions (available at the bottom of the filter sidebar) provides more detailed definitions. 

Many newer measures (especially those with the *Annual Report* tag) are inspired by the proposed changes to the federal Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) measures. We are working to move even closer to the CFSR definitions in the future by using the population in the AFCARS and NCANDS data sets.
