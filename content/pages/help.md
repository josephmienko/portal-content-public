### Browser Issues

Make sure that you are using an up-to-date version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer so that the visualizations and web pages display properly. If you have verified that you are using a recent browser version and are still having trouble, try reloading or refreshing the page.

### I can’t find what I’m looking for

We try to provide visualizations that cover a wide range of topics, but sometimes there are specialized queries we don’t address on the Data Portal. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, please [get in touch](https://www.cssat.org/#contact-us) and we will do our best to give you the information you need.

### The data are different from another report I have

There are many possible reasons for differences in data, for example out-of-home care episodes that last less than one week are omitted from many reports, but we include them by default (they can be filtered out using the advanced filter *duration of out-of-home stay*). Also be careful of time periods, state fiscal years, federal fiscal years, and calendar years are commonly used by different agencies.

For privacy, all counts on the Data Portal are *jittered* - a small amount of random statistical noise is added to the data to prevent individual from being identifiable. All zeroes are kept as zero, and all non-zeroes are kept as non-zero, but reported numbers should be thought of as having a margin of error of at least one or two.
